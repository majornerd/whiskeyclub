Application for Whiskey Clubs to track releases

#Goal
I run a whiskey club in the Denver area and knowing nothing about how whiskey clubs are run, I didn't do it "right" when I started, but my members love it.  I want to create a way for people to start their own club and a tool to track and socialize the whiskey list is valuable.  If it can also be used to track your own whiskey collection that seems like a win for everyone.
